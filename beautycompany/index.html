                <p><h3>Get going in the great outdoors!</h3></p>
				<p>When your child hits grade school, you're left with a narrow window of time in late afternoon when you or her after-school 
					child care provider can encourage your child to exercise. </p>
				<p>Build in some time each day to exercise together — just as you try to have a family meal and keep a bedtime routine. <br />
				Even venturing out after dinner for a walk to search for stars or chase fireflies counts. <br />
				What's most important is that you come up with a game plan that works for your family.</p>
				<p>Make your travel plans with physical activity in mind. Look for family-friendly vacation spots that make exercise easy.</p>
				<p>Find a cabin by a lake, for instance, that includes a canoe to paddle in, a rope to swing from, and some biking trails to explore. </p>
				<p>Plan a summer beach getaway to the shore so you can swim, sail, or boogie board together. Or take a winter break in the snow and go sledding, snow boarding, or cross-country skiing.</p>
				<p>Holiday camps that teach new skills — such as horseback riding, cross-country skiing, or roller blading — are also a fun way to get your grade-schooler going.</p>

                  <p>Have you chosen a side on the vaccination debate?</p>
				  <p>Anti-vaccination propaganda is loud enough that you might think that not vaccinating your child is the norm.</p>
				  <p>This couldn't be further from the truth.  It is imperative that people start speaking up in support of vaccines.</p>
				  <p>So come out of the closet and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jj-keith/vaccines_b_3829948.html?utm_hp_ref=fb&src=sp&comm_ref=false" target="_blank">declare yourself as Pro-vaccine</a>, children are depending on you!</p>
